For Noobs:
	-Python does not use any terminators ex. of a terminator ->  ;
	-Python does not use curly brace, it uses tabs/indenting. Although if 
	 you do opt to put curly braces, it will still parse them.

	Comment Character for Python:
					#  = Single Line comment
					,,, = Multi line comment, it is tab sensitive however so be careful
	Comment Character for Html/pt:
					<!-- = Start of multi line comment
					-->  = End of multi line comment
	For more useful shit, use google. Tbh you should already
	know how to code in python, html is pretty standard aswell.

WorkFlow:
	=HTML pages go in templates, rename extension from .html -> .pt

	=Metal: 
		- Labels stored in user_header.pt
		- Links stored in view_config
